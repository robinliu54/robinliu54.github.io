<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a senior undergraduate student at <a href="https://www.wyc.tsinghua.edu.cn/">Weiyang College</a> in <a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/">Tsinghua University</a>, double majoring in Mathematics & Physics and Civil Engineering and Systems.
I have skills in Transportation, System Engineering, and Statistics. My research interests focus on transit policy, traffic modeling and planning, and human-machine interface on vehicles. My research goal is to elevate awareness about the transformative power of transportation in fostering societal connectivity and equity.

Currently I'm an undergraduate remote visiting scholar at Massachusetts Institute of Technology <a href="https://mobility.mit.edu/">JTL Urban Mobility Lab</a>, advised by <a href="https://mobility.mit.edu/people/jinhua-zhao">Prof. Jinhua Zhao</a>, where I work on topological changes on long-term traffic planning. In Summer 2023, I worked as a visiting scholar at <a href="https://limos.engin.umich.edu/">Lab for Innovative Mobility Systems</a> in University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, supervised by <a href="https://cee.engin.umich.edu/people/yin-yafeng/">Prof. Yafeng Yin</a>, where I work on Delay Operator in Dynamic Traffic Allocation. I'm also a member of the Tsinghua University-Mercedes-Benz Joint Institute for Sustainable Mobility, led by <a href="https://www.civil.tsinghua.edu.cn/ceen/info/1062/1204.htm">Prof. Li Meng</a>, where I collaborated with Mercedes-Benz to develop an intelligent dashboard for their next-generation vehicles. Prior to that, I worked with <a href="https://www.civil.tsinghua.edu.cn/ceen/info/1062/1205.htm">Prof. Ruimin Li</a> on Pricing Systems in transit public policy of Mobility as a Service (MaaS). I was also very fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rnZb4PUAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Yongbin Yang</a>, where I worked on structural analysis of railway bridges.

**I'm actively seeking Graduate Program in Transportation and Operation Research for Fall 2024! 🚗🚌🚇🚆✈**

<!--My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).-->
